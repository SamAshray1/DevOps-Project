# DevOps-Project

Welcome to my DevOps learning repository! This project serves as a hands-on exploration of modern DevOps tools and best practices, focusing on creating an efficient, scalable, and secure infrastructure. The repository will evolve as I gain experience and implement new tools and techniques.

## Project Goals
- **Learn and implement Terraform**: Automate infrastructure provisioning.
- **Explore HashiCorp Vault**: Manage secrets and sensitive data securely.
- **Utilize Ansible**: Configure and manage infrastructure at scale.
- **Integrate Jenkins (future)**: Automate CI/CD pipelines.
- **Incorporate Kubernetes (future)**: Orchestrate containers for scalability and reliability.

---

## Tools and Technologies
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for provisioning resources.
- **Ansible**: Configuration management and automation.
- **Vault**: Secrets management for secure access to credentials and sensitive information.
- **Ubuntu**: Operating system for development and deployments.
- **Jenkins (future)**: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment.
- **Kubernetes (future)**: Container orchestration platform for deployment, scaling, and management.

## Current Implementation

### Features:
1. **Terraform**:
   - Provision EC2 instances on AWS.
   - Set up security groups to open necessary ports (22, 443, 80, 8080).
   - Automatically output instance details (e.g., IP address).

2. **Ansible**:
   - Automate server configuration and application deployment.
   - Install dependencies like Git and JDK 17.
   - Clone code repositories, build, and run applications.

3. **Vault**:
   - Store and manage sensitive credentials and environment variables (under development).

## Future Plans
1. **Jenkins Integration**:
   - Implement CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
   - Integrate with Ansible and Terraform for seamless workflows.

2. **Kubernetes Setup**:
   - Deploy containerized applications.
   - Explore Helm charts for package management.

3. **Enhanced Security**:
   - Use Vault extensively for managing secrets and access policies.
   - Implement best practices for securing Terraform and Ansible workflows.

---

## Best Practices
- Write modular and reusable Terraform and Ansible code.
- Follow the principle of least privilege when managing access.
- Implement version control for infrastructure code and configurations.
- Automate testing and validation for configurations.

## How to Use This Repository
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/devops-learning.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the desired folder (e.g., `terraform`, `ansible`).

3. Follow the README or documentation in the specific folder to execute configurations or playbooks.

4. Contribute or share feedback to improve the project!
