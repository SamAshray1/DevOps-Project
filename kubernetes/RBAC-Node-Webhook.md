These are different **authorization** modes in Kubernetes that control access to API resources. Each mode has its own use case and level of flexibility.

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**  
üëâ The most commonly used authorization mode in Kubernetes.

‚úÖ **How it works:**  
- Uses **Roles** and **RoleBindings** to define permissions.  
- Grants access to users, groups, or service accounts at the **namespace** or **cluster** level.  
- Uses **verbs** (e.g., get, list, create, delete) to define actions on resources.

‚úÖ **Best for:**  
- Managing access at a fine-grained level.  
- Assigning roles based on teams, services, or workloads.

‚úÖ **Example YAML:**
```yaml
kind: Role
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  namespace: dev
  name: dev-reader
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods"]
  verbs: ["get", "list"]
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Node Authorization (NODE)**  
üëâ Specifically for authorizing **Kubelets (nodes)** to access API resources.

‚úÖ **How it works:**  
- Used internally by Kubernetes to restrict what nodes can do.  
- Ensures nodes **only read/write the resources they need** (like their own pods).  
- Usually works alongside **RBAC**.

‚úÖ **Best for:**  
- Securing node-to-API interactions.

‚úÖ **Example:**  
- A node can only access **pods scheduled on itself**, not others.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**  
üëâ A more flexible, **JSON-based policy system**, but **less commonly used**.

‚úÖ **How it works:**  
- Uses a JSON policy file to **define rules based on attributes** (e.g., user, resource, action).  
- More flexible than RBAC, but harder to manage.

‚úÖ **Best for:**  
- When RBAC is too rigid, and you need **custom attributes** in access control.

‚úÖ **Example Policy (JSON file):**
```json
{
  "apiVersion": "abac.authorization.kubernetes.io/v1beta1",
  "kind": "Policy",
  "spec": {
    "user": "dev-user",
    "namespace": "dev",
    "resource": "pods",
    "readonly": true
  }
}
```
‚úÖ **Why it's not widely used?**  
- Requires **manual policy file management**.  
- Kubernetes is **deprecating** ABAC in favor of RBAC.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Webhook Authorization (WEBHOOK)**  
üëâ Custom **external** authorization logic.

‚úÖ **How it works:**  
- When a request comes in, Kubernetes **calls an external service (Webhook)** for authorization.  
- The external service decides whether to allow/deny the request.

‚úÖ **Best for:**  
- Custom authorization logic (e.g., based on external IAM, policy engines like Open Policy Agent).  
- Enforcing **dynamic rules** beyond RBAC.

‚úÖ **Example Webhook Response (from external service):**
```json
{
  "apiVersion": "authorization.k8s.io/v1",
  "kind": "SubjectAccessReview",
  "status": {
    "allowed": true
  }
}
```

### **Comparison Table**
| Mode  | Scope | Best Use Case | Pros | Cons |
|-------|------|--------------|------|------|
| **RBAC** | Cluster & Namespace | Standard Kubernetes access control | Simple, widely used, well-supported | Can get complex for large clusters |
| **Node** | Node to API Server | Limits node permissions | Lightweight, built-in | Only for node-specific access |
| **ABAC** | Cluster-wide | Attribute-based control | Flexible, supports custom rules | Hard to manage, deprecated |
| **Webhook** | External | Custom authorization logic | Highly customizable, integrates with IAM | Requires an external service |

---

### **Which One Should You Use?**
‚úÖ **RBAC** ‚Üí Default, best for most cases.  
‚úÖ **Node Authorization** ‚Üí Internal node permissions.  
‚úÖ **Webhook** ‚Üí If RBAC isn‚Äôt enough, use an external policy engine (e.g., Open Policy Agent).  
‚ùå **ABAC** ‚Üí Avoid, as it's deprecated.
