**History of K8s**
The design and development of Kubernetes was inspired by Google's Borg cluster manager and based on Promise Theory.
Kubernetes was released in 2015. Google worked with the Linux Foundation to form the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) and offered Kubernetes as the seed technology.

**Monolithic vs Microservices**
Monolithic Architecture is single tier, where all the components are tightly coupled and deployed as a single unit.
Due to the tight coupling,
> Entire application may fail, if one component fails.
> Less flexible as each component cannot be developed, deployed and scaled independently.
Only pro is that communication is faster due to the coupling.

Microservices Architecture is multi-tier, where the components are small, loosely coupled and each individual component/service can be deployed independently.
> Individual components can be developed, deployed and scaled independently.
> An individual service can fail without affecting the other services.
There is more complexity while managing, and also the communication between components is slower due to network calls.
